## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
###$This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data"


The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 
link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here are the data for the project: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The R code, in run_analysis.R, takes for granted that all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.   
CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps in the project assignment. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
